Import from `@anvia/core` or `@anvia/core/skills`.

## Skill Types

```ts
type Skill = {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly description: string;
  readonly instructions: string;
  readonly directory: string;
  readonly references: string[];
  readonly scripts: string[];
  readonly license?: string;
  readonly metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};

type SkillLoader = {
  load(): Promise<Skill[]>;
};

type SkillSet = {
  readonly skills: Skill[];
  readonly tools: Tool[];
  readonly instructions: string;
};
```

Purpose: loaded skill metadata and instruction/tool bundle.

Return behavior: `SkillSet` is consumed by `AgentBuilder.skills(...)`.

Notable errors: loaders can reject.

## loadSkills

```ts
function loadSkills(loaders: SkillLoader | SkillLoader[]): Promise<SkillSet>;
```

Purpose: load one or more skill sources, merge by skill name, generate instructions, and create skill tools.

Return behavior: later loaders override earlier skills with the same name.

Notable errors: rejects with loader errors or `SkillValidationError` from local loaders.

## skill.local

```ts
const skill: {
  local(path: string): SkillLoader;
};
```

Purpose: create a loader for one skill directory or a directory containing multiple skill directories.

Return behavior: `load()` discovers `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `scripts/`.

Notable errors: throws `SkillValidationError` for invalid frontmatter, invalid names, missing descriptions, or directory/name mismatches.

## Validation Types

```ts
type SkillValidationIssue = {
  path: string;
  message: string;
};

class SkillValidationError extends Error {
  readonly issues: SkillValidationIssue[];
}
```

Purpose: structured local skill validation failures.

Return behavior: thrown by local loading.

Notable errors: this is the notable skills error.
