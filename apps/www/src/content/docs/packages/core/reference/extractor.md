Import from `@anvia/core` or `@anvia/core/extractor`.

## ExtractionResponse

```ts
type ExtractionResponse<T> = {
  data: T;
  usage: Usage;
  messages: Message[];
};
```

Purpose: extraction result with usage and generated messages.

Return behavior: returned by `Extractor.extractWithUsage(...)`.

Notable errors: none directly.

## Extractor

```ts
class Extractor<T, M extends CompletionModel = CompletionModel> {
  extract(text: string | Message): Promise<T>;
  extractWithUsage(text: string | Message): Promise<ExtractionResponse<T>>;
  extractWithHistory(text: string | Message, history: Message[]): Promise<T>;
  getInner(): Agent<M>;
}
```

Purpose: run a model with a required `submit` tool and parse the submitted arguments against a schema.

Return behavior: `extract(...)` resolves schema-typed data; `getInner()` returns the underlying agent.

Notable errors: throws `ExtractionError` when the model does not submit data, schema validation fails across all retries, or the model call fails.

## ExtractorBuilder

```ts
class ExtractorBuilder<T, M extends CompletionModel = CompletionModel> {
  constructor(model: M, schema: ZodSchema<T>);
  instructions(instructions: string): this;
  context(text: string, id?: string): this;
  temperature(temperature: number): this;
  maxTokens(maxTokens: number): this;
  additionalParams(params: JsonValue): this;
  toolChoice(toolChoice: ToolChoice): this;
  retries(retries: number): this;
  build(): Extractor<T, M>;
}
```

Purpose: configure an extractor around a completion model and Zod schema.

Return behavior: mutators return `this`; `build()` returns an `Extractor`.

Notable errors: schema conversion can throw; extraction errors are raised by the built extractor.

## ExtractionError

```ts
class ExtractionError extends Error {
  readonly cause?: unknown;
}
```

Purpose: wraps extraction failures.

Return behavior: thrown by extraction methods.

Notable errors: this is the notable extractor error.
