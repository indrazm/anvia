## Approval Types

```ts
type StudioToolApprovalDecision = {
  approved: boolean;
  reason?: string;
};

type StudioToolApprovalStatus = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected" | "timed_out";
```

Purpose: Studio-owned approval contracts for HTTP decisions, records, and UI state.

Return behavior: type-only exports.

Notable errors: none directly.

## StudioToolApproval

```ts
type StudioToolApproval = {
  id: string;
  runId: string;
  agentId: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  toolName: string;
  callId?: string;
  internalCallId: string;
  args: string;
  status: StudioToolApprovalStatus;
  requestedAt: string;
  resolvedAt?: string;
  reason?: string;
};
```

Purpose: persisted approval request/result record for Studio.

Return behavior: returned by approval routes and stream events.

Notable errors: none directly.

## Transcript and Stream Events

```ts
type StudioToolApprovalTranscript = {
  id: string;
  status: StudioToolApprovalStatus;
  requestedAt: string;
  resolvedAt?: string;
  reason?: string;
};

type StudioToolApprovalRequestEvent = {
  type: "tool_approval_request";
  approval: StudioToolApproval;
};

type StudioToolApprovalResultEvent = {
  type: "tool_approval_result";
  approval: StudioToolApproval;
};
```

Purpose: represent approval state in transcripts and run streams.

Return behavior: events are included in `AgentRunStreamEvent`.

Notable errors: invalid approval decisions return Studio HTTP errors from approval routes.

## Question Types

```ts
type StudioToolQuestionChoice = {
  label: string;
  value: string;
};

type StudioToolQuestionPrompt = {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  choices: StudioToolQuestionChoice[];
};

type StudioToolQuestionAnswer = {
  questionId: string;
  answer: string;
  choice?: string;
  custom?: boolean;
};

type StudioToolQuestionStatus = "pending" | "answered";
```

Purpose: represent a human question requested by a tool such as `ask_question`.

Return behavior: type-only exports used by Studio question records, transcripts, and stream events.

Notable errors: invalid answers return Studio HTTP errors from question routes.

## StudioToolQuestion

```ts
type StudioToolQuestion = {
  id: string;
  runId: string;
  agentId: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  toolName: string;
  callId?: string;
  internalCallId: string;
  args: string;
  questions: StudioToolQuestionPrompt[];
  status: StudioToolQuestionStatus;
  requestedAt: string;
  answeredAt?: string;
  answers?: StudioToolQuestionAnswer[];
};
```

Purpose: persisted question request/result record for Studio.

Return behavior: returned by question routes and stream events.

Notable errors: none directly.

## Question Transcript and Stream Events

```ts
type StudioToolQuestionTranscript = {
  id: string;
  status: StudioToolQuestionStatus;
  requestedAt: string;
  answeredAt?: string;
  questions: StudioToolQuestionPrompt[];
  answers?: StudioToolQuestionAnswer[];
};

type StudioToolQuestionRequestEvent = {
  type: "tool_question_request";
  question: StudioToolQuestion;
};

type StudioToolQuestionResultEvent = {
  type: "tool_question_result";
  question: StudioToolQuestion;
};
```

Purpose: represent pending and answered human questions in transcripts and run streams.

Return behavior: events are included in `AgentRunStreamEvent`.

Notable errors: unanswered questions keep the run waiting until a Studio answer route resolves them.
