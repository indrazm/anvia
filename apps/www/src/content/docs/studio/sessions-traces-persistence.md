Studio records local runtime evidence so development and internal operations can answer what happened in a run. The key surfaces are sessions, traces, memory, status, pipeline logs, and pipeline run history.

Run the inspection surfaces example:

```sh
pnpm cookbook:studio:09
```

Then open the runtime status page:

```txt
http://localhost:4021/ui/status
```

## Sessions

Sessions group transcript entries for Studio runs. After you create a Playground session, the Sessions page can show the user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, approval state, question state, and run status stored for that conversation.

Studio session storage is a development/runtime concern. Product conversation memory should still be designed as part of your application boundary.

## Traces

Traces capture runtime observations such as agent runs, model generations, tools, timings, status, and usage when available. Use the tracing page when you need to debug behavior across turns or compare local runs.

## Memory and Status

The Memory page exposes the memory store shape that Studio can inspect. The Status page reports runtime counts and capability flags, while `/status` returns the raw status API response.

`09-inspection-surfaces.ts` prints these URLs:

```txt
http://localhost:4021/ui/memory
http://localhost:4021/ui/status
http://localhost:4021/status
```

## Persistent Store

Run the SQLite store example:

```sh
pnpm cookbook:studio:10
```

It writes local Studio state to:

```txt
.anvia-studio/cookbook-studio.sqlite
```

The example passes one SQLite store through:

```ts
new Studio([agent, escalationPipeline], {
  stores: {
    sessions: store,
    traces: store,
    pipelineLogs: store,
    pipelineRuns: store,
  },
});
```

Use this when you want sessions, traces, pipeline logs, and pipeline run history to survive process restarts during local development.
