Studio makes tool behavior visible before and during agent runs. The Tools page lists registered tools, input schemas, output schemas, approval metadata, and direct run controls.

Run the inspection surfaces example:

```sh
pnpm cookbook:studio:09
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:4021/ui/tools
```

## Direct Tool Runs

`09-inspection-surfaces.ts` registers a `get_ticket` tool backed by local application state. The Tools page can run that tool directly with an argument object such as:

```json
{
  "id": "TICKET-1001"
}
```

Use this before debugging the model path. If the direct tool run fails, the problem is in the tool contract or application boundary, not in prompting.

## Tool Approvals

Run the approval example:

```sh
pnpm cookbook:studio:03
```

It demonstrates two approval paths:

- `issue_refund` declares approval metadata on the tool itself.
- `cancel_order` requests approval from an agent hook.

Both paths keep the model from completing the action until the operator approves or rejects the pending request in Studio.

## Operator Questions

Run the human feedback example:

```sh
pnpm cookbook:studio:04
```

It defines an `ask_question` tool for missing operator input. The tool asks multiple bounded questions in one call, and Studio renders choices plus custom input before the agent continues.

Use this for values that should come from a human operator rather than from model inference: priority, escalation channel, reviewer notes, or a final confirmation value.
