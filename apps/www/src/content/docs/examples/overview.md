Examples show common Anvia application shapes. They are not tiny API snippets and they are not long tutorials. Each page should answer a build question: "If I want to build this kind of agent, ingestion flow, tool boundary, or production loop, what does the Anvia shape look like?"

The examples use concrete defaults where a full flow is easier to understand with real adapters: OpenAI `gpt-5.5` for support model examples, Anthropic `claude-opus-4.8` for escalation or judge examples, Mistral OCR for scanned documents, OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` for embeddings, and Chroma for the primary vector store.

## Common Flows

Agent applications usually start with [Agent App Flow](/docs/examples/agent-app-flow): a thin route or job calls a runner, the runner resolves product state, the agent runs with scoped tools and context, and the application persists the result.

Knowledge applications usually combine [RAG Ingestion](/docs/examples/rag-ingestion), [Retrieval Agent](/docs/examples/retrieval-agent), and [Document Grounding](/docs/examples/document-grounding). The important flow is source documents to OCR or text extraction, chunks, embeddings, Chroma-backed vector index, dynamic context or retrieval tools, then cited answers.

Action-taking applications usually combine [Permissioned Tools](/docs/examples/permissioned-tools), [Tool Validation](/docs/examples/tool-validation), [Guarded Side Effects](/docs/examples/guarded-side-effects), and [Human Input](/docs/examples/human-input). The model can request work, but application code owns permissions, approval, idempotency, audit, and safe output.

Production applications usually add [Runtime State and Persistence](/docs/examples/runtime-state-persistence), [Testing Harness](/docs/examples/testing-harness), [Observability Loop](/docs/examples/observability-loop), [Eval Loop](/docs/examples/eval-loop), and [Production Readiness](/docs/examples/production-readiness). Observability records runtime evidence. Evals replay behavior through target adapters and check it with deterministic metrics first.
