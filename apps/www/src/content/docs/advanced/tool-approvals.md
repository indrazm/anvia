Approvals pause sensitive tool execution until application code returns a decision. Use them for high-risk side effects such as refunds, account changes, outbound messages, destructive actions, or operations that need human review.

Approvals are a runtime gate. They do not replace handler-level authorization, validation, idempotency, or audit logging.

## Approvals Or Guardrails

Use tool approvals when the right next step is a decision: approve or reject this
specific tool call before it executes. An approved decision lets the runtime attempt the
tool call. It does not guarantee the product operation will succeed.

Use guardrails when the right next step can be automatic: block unsafe input, rewrite
unsafe input, or sanitize the final assistant response.

| Situation | Prefer |
| --- | --- |
| A reviewer must approve a sensitive side effect | tool approval |
| A tool always knows its own approval threshold | tool-level `approval` policy |
| A run-specific policy may pause several tools | hook-driven approval |
| User input should be blocked or redacted before the model sees it | input guardrail |
| Final assistant text should be blocked or redacted before the user sees it | output guardrail |

Neither approvals nor guardrails are product authorization. The tool implementation must
still check the current actor, tenant, target resource, business state, idempotency, and
audit requirements.

In practice, approval answers "should this run continue into the tool?" The tool still
answers "is this actor allowed to perform this operation on this resource right now?"

## Tool-Level Approval Policy

Add an `approval` policy to a tool when the tool itself knows when approval is required:

```ts
import { createTool } from "@anvia/core";
import type { ToolApprovalPolicy, ToolApprovalsOptions } from "@anvia/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const refundInput = z.object({
  orderId: z.string(),
  amountCents: z.number().int().positive(),
  reason: z.string(),
});

const refundApproval = {
  when(ctx) {
    return ctx.args.amountCents > 5000;
  },
  reason(ctx) {
    return `Refund ${ctx.args.amountCents} cents for ${ctx.args.orderId}.`;
  },
  rejectMessage: "The refund was not approved.",
} satisfies ToolApprovalPolicy<z.infer<typeof refundInput>>;

const requestRefund = createTool({
  name: "request_refund",
  description: "Request a refund for an eligible order.",
  input: refundInput,
  approval: refundApproval,
  async execute(args) {
    await auth.requireRefundPermission(user.id, args.orderId);
    return refunds.createRequest(args);
  },
});
```

The `when(...)` function receives parsed and validated tool arguments. If it returns `false`, the tool runs normally. If it returns `true`, the runtime calls the approval handler configured on the prompt request.

## Request Approval Handler

Configure approval handling on the prompt request:

```ts
const approvals = {
  async handler(request) {
    const decision = await reviewerQueue.requestDecision({
      toolName: request.toolName,
      args: request.args,
      reason: request.reason,
      runId: request.run.runId,
      sessionId: request.run.sessionId,
    });

    if (decision.approved) {
      return { approved: true, reason: decision.reason };
    }

    return {
      approved: false,
      reason: decision.reason,
      rejectMessage: "A reviewer rejected this action.",
    };
  },
} satisfies ToolApprovalsOptions;

const session = agent.session(threadId, { userId: user.id });
const request = session.prompt(message).approvals(approvals);
const response = await request.send();
```

When approval is rejected, core returns the rejection message as the tool result and the agent can continue the conversation. The handler should persist reviewer decisions in your application system.

## Missing Approval Handler

If a tool requests approval and the prompt request has no approval handler, core throws `ToolApprovalRequiredError`.

```ts
import { ToolApprovalRequiredError } from "@anvia/core";

try {
  const response = await request.send();
  return response.output;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ToolApprovalRequiredError) {
    await approvalInbox.store(error.request);
    return "This action needs approval before it can continue.";
  }

  throw error;
}
```

Use this pattern when the first request should only create an approval task. Core does not provide a resume token for a paused run; your application must start the later continuation with an approval handler or use a runtime that keeps the approval handler pending until a decision arrives.

## Hook-Driven Approval

Hooks can request approval even when the tool does not declare an approval policy:

```ts
import { createHook } from "@anvia/core";

const approvalHook = createHook({
  onToolCall({ toolName, args, tool }) {
    if (toolName === "send_email" && args.includes("enterprise")) {
      return tool.requestApproval({
        reason: "Outbound email to enterprise customer.",
        rejectMessage: "The email was not sent.",
      });
    }
  },
});
```

Use hook-driven approvals for workflow policy that depends on the current run. Use tool-level approval for policy that belongs to the tool contract.

## Approval Context

Approval requests include:

- tool name
- parsed arguments
- raw JSON arguments
- provider tool call id when available
- internal call id
- run id
- agent id
- session id when the run uses memory
- run metadata
- reason and reject message when provided

Do not expose the whole request blindly to reviewers. Project it into a review UI that redacts private fields and explains the action clearly.

## Approval Checklist

Before shipping approvals, check:

- the handler persists decisions and reviewer identity
- rejection messages are safe for the model and user
- approved tools still enforce permissions
- side effects are idempotent or protected by business constraints
- missing handlers are mapped to product approval tasks
